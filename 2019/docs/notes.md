# notes

here's some thoughts on the exercises as I work through them, and notes on stuff I learned.

## 0101 - 0202

started a day late. so here's day 1 and day 2 all at one go.

- 0101: nothing much to report here. tried to make it super functional. quick and fun.

- 0102: got to do a little recursive function here. still not much to write home about.

- 0201: way over thought this one at first trying to make it classically OOP.
  scraped the lot and just wrote it imperative style

- 0202: more imperativeness. classic old nested for loop

Other notes:

- started using the stupid test "framework" I wrote last year. gonna try to
  make this more TDD this go around. we'll see how long I stick to that :/
