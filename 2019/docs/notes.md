# notes

here's some thoughts on the exercises as I work through them, and notes on stuff I learned.

## 0101 - 0202

started a day late. so here's day 1 and day 2 all at one go.

- [0101](https://github.com/chrisman/advent-of-code/blob/master/2019/src/0101.js): nothing much to report here. tried to make it super functional. quick and fun.

- [0102](https://github.com/chrisman/advent-of-code/blob/master/2019/src/0102.js): got to do a little recursive function here. still not much to write home about.

- [0201](https://github.com/chrisman/advent-of-code/blob/master/2019/src/0201.js): way over thought this one at first trying to make it classically OOP.
  scraped the lot and just wrote it imperative style. not my favorite way to write stuff, but sometimes it's just necessary.

- [0202](https://github.com/chrisman/advent-of-code/blob/master/2019/src/0202.js): more imperativeness. classic old nested for loop

Other notes:

- started using the [stupid test "framework" I wrote last year](https://github.com/chrisman/advent-of-code/blob/master/2019/test/tap.js). gonna try to
  make this more TDD this go around. we'll see how long I stick to that :/ Maybe I'll be able to hack on it some more and get it to produce some better [TAP](http://testanything.org/)
