# Advent of Code 2020

what is up 2020

if previous years are any indication of how this will go[^1], I expect I will start strong for a couple days and then fizzle out and drop off.

Consequently, while I had grand plans for this year to get weird and do AoC in some kind of lisp, I think instead I shall stay closer to my comfort zone and write some javascript.

I shall indulge my fancy by writing typescript, which I haven't done in a long time, and by using the deno runtime.

deno is going to be a killer java/typescript platform:

1. native typescript support
2. built in testing, formatting, and linting
3. import/export js modules
4. native async/await
5. a standard library and sane dependency management

Items 1 - 3 alone obviate the need for a *ton* of JS tooling. No need to babel or webpack, or jest/mocha/tape, or eslint or prettify. Just start writing.

item 5 is a killer feature too: no npm, no node_modules.
